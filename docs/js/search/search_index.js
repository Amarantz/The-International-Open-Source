Owned rooms are called communes, offensive and defensive forces are called the Red Army, economic workers are known as the Proletariat, and the Revolutionaries establish new communes and rebuild destroyed ones.\nThis bot can provide experienced and new players a reference for when they get stuck, need inspiration, or want to laugh at some terrible code. Comments are used commonly, and code is structured so it can be easily understood, replicated, and expanded upon. Please follow similar guidelines if you make a pull request 🙂.\nFeel welcome to fork it and otherwise use it, however do not be overly aggressive on the Screeps world, especially to newer players. The bot is intended to be automated, but can perform manual actions via the console. It has an information panel showing progress, events, economy, military, and more.\nIf you have specific questions or want to discuss the bot, please join our discord server.\n\n\n\n\nProgress and Design\nGrafana board\nVideos\nMarvinTMB's screeps profile\nPlans and bugs\nWiki\nRequirements\nPlease read the about section before installing and using this bot.\nFirst you'll want to download or fork the repository. Start by selecting a branch: Main is more stable but is often behind on features and improvements, while Development has more bugs, features and optimizations.\nNPM\nEnsure you have downloaded Node\nMake sure your node version is below 17.0.0\nYou can check your node version with:\nnode -v\nIf your node version is too recent, you can change it with NVM:\nLinux/MacOS nvm\nWindows nvm-windows\nAfter making sure you have correct node version go to the project folder (not in src), you'll want to install the dependencies like so:\nnpm i\nAnd that's it. Join our discord server if you need help.\nUsage\nBefore you use this bot, please consider two things. First, if you're a new player and especially one that wants to learn programming, JS, or TS, then this is not the place to start. I strongly encourage you to start your own bot and achieve a decent economy before using or contributing to this bot.\nSecondly, DO NOT USE THIS BOT TO BULLY. Do not attack noobs, taking their remotes or claimed rooms. This is a fun game where people often program their own bots from scratch, so it is entirely fun-ruining and incredibly rude to pick on those who aren't using an open source bot like this one. If you find yourself against another open source bot, or a bot that can put up a fair fight against you, then best of luck. Please feel welcome to share experiences or ask questions in the discord server.\nTo begin, you need to decide what branch to use. Main is generally old but stable, while Development is less stable but more up to date. If you want to find bugs or test new features, Development is for you.\nUsing rollup we will translate the code into a single js file, which will be used in environments set in .screeps.yaml file (see below if you don't have one yet). This compiles the code so it can be run by Screeps while we develop using folders and typescript.\nFirst, you'll need to set up your settings. In /src you'll find the settings.example.ts file. Please copy the folder and rename its clone to settings.ts. Then change the settingsExample definition to settings. You can then add your own prefences, including checks based on the name of the shard for server-specific settings. These same instructions with an example is included in the file.\nNext, rename .screeps.yaml.example to .screeps.yaml and fill in the required information for each environment you want to run the bot in. For the official server, replace the token with an API token for your account. On private servers, edit (or copy and rename) the pserver section with host set to your server domain or IP then complete username and password with your credentials on this server. For more information about this file, check the screeps unified credentials file spec.\nRunning rollup -c will compile your code and do a \"dry run\", preparing the code for upload but not actually pushing it. Running rollup -c --environment DEST:mmo will compile your code, and then upload it to a screeps server using the mmo config from .screeps.yaml.\nYou can use -cw instead of -c to automatically re-run when your source code changes - for example, rollup -cw --environment DEST:main will automatically upload your code to the mmo configuration every time your code is changed.\nFinally, there are also NPM scripts that serve as aliases for these commands in package.json for IDE integration. Running npm run push-mmo is equivalent to rollup -c --environment DEST:mmo, and npm run watch-pserver is equivalent to rollup -cw --dest pserver.\nImportant! To upload code to a private server, you must have screepsmod-auth installed and configured!\nFor more information, please go to the wiki\nGrafana\nSoon to be added again when PandaMaster fixes the new ScreepsPlus replacement site!\nPrivate server\nTo run the bot on an performance checking server, run npm run server and check out localhost:21025 (server) and localhost:3000 (grafana) in your browser. Alternatives with in-depth instructions can be found at Using a Private Server\nFor the performance server users, its always RoomName as email and password is password.\nIf you'd like to use rollup to compile to a private server, you'll need to download and configure screepsmod-auth to push your code.\nI'd also suggest using this less-laggy tool steamless-client to watch your private server run from the comfort of your browser.\nAdvanced usage\nIf you want to run custom code without conflicting with the project's source - say, if you want to commit or make pull requests - it's recommended you use the userScript folder. Head to src/other/userScript/userScript.example.ts and follow the instructions at the top of the file.\nContribution\nWe're a huge fan of teamwork, and many useful features of this bot have been added by contributors.\nIf you want to join us in development for this bot, please join our discord server and share what you're working on, or hoping to add. We're happy to review issues, merge pull requests, and add collaborators!\nPlease use the development branch for pull requests, commits, etc.\nAn extra special thanks to Panda Master, Allorrian, Plaid Rabbit, Aerics, and DefaultO, SimplyAlex, shu for their essential contribution to this project.\nSupport\nIf you'd like to support the project, Carson Burke (AKA MarvinTMB) is happy to accept single time or monthly donations through the following links.\nPaypal\nPatreon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2022 The International Screeps\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
